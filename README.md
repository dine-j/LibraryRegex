# LibraryRegex

**1st year course project**: Basic media library using regular expressions

## Domain description

*Media Servers*, in order to facilitate access to your personal media content, present a
*library* of available media. This library is often built from media source files that have
heterogeneous naming schemes, yet the library itself is presented in a uniform manner.

## Code

It's a Java program displaying in a uniform manner files in a library, i.e. Title - Year - Definition
We had a **constraint** as follow: **no methods from the String class (or any other class
that facilitates string manipulation) should be used**, especially **replace**, **split** and **substring**.

## Aims

* To use regular expressions to solve practical problems;
* To continue working with components, layout managers and events.
